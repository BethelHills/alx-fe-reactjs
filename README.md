# alx-fe-reactjs

This repository contains several small Vite + React demo projects used during development and exercises.

Included projects:

- `alx-react-app` — example app with components.
- `github-user-search` — GitHub user search demo (uses React Query in some components).
- `form-handling-react` — examples of controlled and Formik forms.
- `react-query-demo` — React Query caching demo.
- `react-router-advanced` — demo for nested, protected, and dynamic routes using React Router.

How to run a demo (example for `react-router-advanced`):

```bash
cd react-router-advanced
npm install
npm run dev
```

Each demo has its own `package.json` and should be run from the demo directory unless a root `package.json` exists for the top-level demo.
